<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; color: #000000;"> <strong>....Wait, wait, hold on!<br>
  <br>
</strong>Moment of Woke, of Radical Authenticity, of breaking through the bullshit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; color: #000000;"> That's not our authentic pitch for asking for donations, that's just the one that's in-line with cultural values. (Offering a &quot;product&quot; in exchange for dollars.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; color: #000000;">ButÂ we absuolutely dislike that model, and we propose a radically different one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; color: #000000;"> <strong>So, what's the real pitch for  asking for money?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; color: #000000;">This is our Job. We are Employed by You, Real People. (We won't call you &quot;Consumers.&quot; We respect you.) One of our underpinning philosophies at Positive Enabler is we believe in a just society. And in that world, we believe that individuals who positively effect society not only can, <strong>but should</strong>,<strong> and by right aught to,</strong> be able to support a modest lifestyle through virtue of their unique, beneficial contributions. We live in a society where dollars are a necessity, so we are asking you to trade a few dollars if you find value in our work to help support our simple lifestyle. We live in an apartment, we eat simple foods, and value local farmers, not the industrial agricultural system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; color: #000000;">We spend time developing podcast content. We do it because we love doing it and because we want to make a difference, a contribution, and we dream of a world where everyone gets paid for doing what they love and making a difference. <strong>We're trying to be the change we wish to see and we're asking for your help to do that. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; color: #000000;">It still remains necessary in our world to trade dollars for our basic needs. If you like our content, please help us maintain enough &quot;paid-time&quot; (not free time) in our day to continue producing it. We wish to spend our free time relaxing, and our paid time producing content of value to You, to offer new thoughts &amp; insights that help transcend the many outdated and entrenched worldviews that govern modern culture. That's our dream job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; color: #000000;">If this sounds reasonable to you, please consider a monthly donation, even it it's just $1. That's worth more than a one-time donation because it ensures sustainability. Of course we also welcome one-time contributions of any amount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; color: #000000;"><strong>And no matter what you contribute, you still get the free e-book! : )<br>
