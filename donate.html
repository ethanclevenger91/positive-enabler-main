<p><br /><strong>Make a donation of any amount and get a free Kindle download of my most recent book, "Don't Read this Book! It might cause a mid-life crisis!" (As "Waking Up from the Matrix" tends to do.)</strong></p>
<p>.....wait, wait, hold on. Moment of truth. (...of Authenticity). That's not the real reason we're asking for donations, that's just the one that's in-line with cultural values. That we're offering a "product" in exchange for "dollars."</p>
<p>But&nbsp;honestly, we don't like that model, and we propose a radically different one.</p>
<p><strong>So, what's the real reason we're asking for a donation?</strong></p>
<p>This is our Job. We are Employed by You, Real People. (We won't call you "Consumers." We respect you!) One of our underpinning philosophies at Positive Enabler is we believe in a just society. And in that world, individuals who positively effect society not only can, but should, be able to support a moderate lifestyle through virtue of their unique, beneficial contributions. We live in a society where dollars are a necessity, so we are asking you to trade a few dollars if you find value in our work, to help support our simple lifestyle.</p>
<p>We spend time developing podcast content. We do it because we love doing it and because we want to make a difference, a contribution, and we dream of a world where eveyone gets paid for doing what they love and making a difference. We're trying to be the change we wish to see. We're asking for your help to do that.</p>
<p>The world we dream of is one where food &amp; housing is freely available. But until then, it remains necessary to trade dollars for our basic needs. If you like our content, please help us maintain enough "paid-time" (not free time) in our day to continue producing it. We wish to spend our free time relaxing, and our paid time producing content of value to You. That's our dream job.</p>
<p>If this sounds reasonable to you, please consider a monthly donation, even it it's just $1. That's worth more than a one-time donation because it ensures sustainability. Of course we also welcome one-time contributions of any amount.</p>
<p><strong>And nomatter what you contribute, you still get the free e-book! :)</strong></p>
