        The light of Conscious Awareness is the ability to identify, consciously, all the walls that have been sub-consciously created in the past which keep you vibrating in the same patterns over and over and over again.<br />
        These walls are not made of brick or stone.<br />
        <br />
        If they were, they would probably be easier to knock down.<br />
        <br />
        Rather, I see them more like walls of crystal, beautiful  geometric, yet transparent walls, keeping you from walking forward. These crystal walls obscure your vision of what is beyond them, yet at the same time, appear invisible to the Naked Mind.<br />
        <br />
        When you take the Spotlight of Conscious Awareness out of your meta-conscious pocket, and shine the light onto the walls, their crystalline structure refracts the light back like a prism. And this reveals their existence in your mind for the first time. </span><br />

      <p><span class="callouts-left">Insight is 20/20</span><span class="body"><br />
      How many times have you heard the expression, &quot;Hindsight is 20/20&quot;? We usually invoke it when talking about something we regret. Then we might say to ourselves, &quot;At least I know better for next time.&quot; How many times have you said that?<br />
        <br />
        But more importantly, how many times do we actually learn the lesson our mistakes were trying to teach us?<br />
        Hindsight is thinking about the past. But that's not all that useful on its own. Hindsight only works in partnership with its significant other: insight.<br />
        <br />
        One way of thinking about insight is that it's learning how to see the patterns between the past and the present, before it's too late.<br />
        <br />
        Invoke insight at the first moment you notice an old pattern that's repeating.<br />
        <br />
        Right now, at this very moment, is when insight is needed the most: use it to connect a past event (which we told ourselves we could learn from) with a present event, happening now. Recognize the recurring pattern at the moment it starts to repeat: that's insight.<br />
        <br />
        Insight is recognizing in this moment, that this is one of those times.<br />
        <br />
        Then, only then, by seeing that, can you cultivate the mindfulness, intent, compassion and action necessary for changing your behavior, and acting in a different, skillful, insightful way.</span></p>

      <span class="callouts"> Meditation is like Lasik surgery<br />
for your Consciousness.</span><br />
<br />
<hr />
<span class="body"><strong>There are a couple key aspects of BlindThought which can be useful to transcend through meditation: </strong><br />
<br />
1) Too often, we don't realize what's true and what's simply been told to us as true. We don't always realize when we believe something simply because we've been told it's true.<br />
<br />
2) We don't realize where our motivations come from for doing the things we do. The motivations we think are our own are actually the motivations society has told us we should have, and we parrot those back, and falsely internalize them as our own. But oftentimes, we're simply not self-aware (awake) enough to realize we're not being honest with ourselves.</span>
<hr />
<span class="callouts-left">A New Spirituality, rooted in the fundamental truth that Consciousness Affects Reality, is sweeping across our culture right now. It's amazing to watch. It's like seeing the sunrise for the first time.</span><span class="body"><br />
<br />
What we are washing away, purifying, is a negative, toxic mindset that has been with us for far too long now.<br />
<br />
I see so many of us already waking up, that I believe critical mass in inevitable.<br />
 <br />
And we're not just saying no to the old way, we're replacing it with a new world view:<br />
<br />
We have the Secret, the Power of Intention, the the Force, to guide us, the Power of Positive Thinking.</span>
<hr />
<br />
<p class="callouts-left">The DNA of Indra's Web</p>
<p class="body"><strong>Buddhists have a beautiful vision of the Universe:</strong><br />
  Imagine a Spiderweb at dawn, each thread of the web glistening with morning dew. Each dew is glinting with the morning sun, newly rising. And within each dew drop is contained the reflection of every other dew drop, and every other reflection of the sun reflected in every other dewdrop. And you are just a dew-drop, reflecting the sun and every other dew drop around you. Each of us reflects every other dew drop surrounding us. The entire web is reflected in every little part.<br />
  <br />
  When an insect lands somewhere on the web, every fiber of the web vibrates. <span class="callouts-left">This image is known as Indra's Web, and illustrates the mutual interdependence of all things.</span> And we are the weavers of the web. As we act, so do we vibrate the web and everything contained within it.</p>
<p class="body"><strong>Western Science shows us this is true as well. </strong>Contained in every single strand of DNA, is all the information necessary to clone a whole person.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="callouts-left">Imagine this mindset, because if you can imagine it, you can get there: </span><span class="body"><br />
  <br />
  You are sitting on the shore of a beautiful island. Beautiful palm trees at your back, sea gulls chirping overhead. It's a beautiful place. This is where you live now, your current life. It has its problems, but in general, you have mostly everything you need, and you're comfortable here.<br />
  <br />
  But you're sitting on the beach, overlooking the ocean before you, watching the waves come in. And in the distance, you see another island.<br />
  <br />
  And gazing at this island, although you can't see it clearly from here, you know that's the Life of Your Dreams.<br />
  <br />
  We have to spend time imagining what this island looks like in order to create it. Consciousness creates reality, afterall. Nevertheless, you can't conceptualize every tree, animal or all of the beautiful cliffs and vantage points on that Island until you actually get there.<br />
  <br />
  </span><span class="callouts-left">We need to conceptualize the Life of Our Dreams, but leave the details to the Higher Consciousness of creation. </span><span class="callouts-left">Have faith that the island of your dreams you have conceived of in your mind is going to be far more beautiful than anything you can possibly conceive of staring at it from this distant shore.</span><br />
